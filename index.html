                <p style="font-size:x-large ;"> The history of Hafez Mustafa goes back to the 19th century. There were famous confectioners in Anatolia in Istanbul in the 19th century. Those who came to the capital from the arid towns of Anatolia may have taken refuge in this branch of the profession in solidarity with their fellow countrymen. Ismail Haki Bey, who came from the central city of Cankiri, found himself among the confectioners of Hamidiye Street in Bahcekapi, although his art was serafIn. 1864, he began making rock candy in the basement of the building where he acquired the space; He became the person who introduced and loved pastries to the people of Istanbul with his sons who helped him in addition to the variety of this habit and the increasing sweets. Mustafa, one of his sons, helped his father on the one hand and was a muezzin in the Arbaşilar Mosque. The flavor and centuries-old trading traditions of the property have changed hands for more than a hundred years, but the location of the first candy store and the lingering taste buds have never changed.<hr></p>
